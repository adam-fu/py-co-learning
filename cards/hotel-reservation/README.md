# Hotel Room Reservation System

The aim of the exercice is to create a simple hotel reservation System.

## Results of the group discussion:

* Group1 builds a class Rooms, that carries properties: id(int), price(int), seaview (bool), rooms(int), booked(list of strings), roomname(str).
* Group2 builds a graphical interface to interact with the Hotel class, that stores the rooms and the booking information.

##TO DO:
* After we initiate our first hotel with random rooms, we have to store our hotel configuration on hard-disk. Ideally, we store the hotel properties in JSON format.
* Adapt the code to fit our needs and think about how we generate the hotel rooms and how we store it on disk.
