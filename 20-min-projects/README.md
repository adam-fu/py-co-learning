# 20 minutes projects

At the OpenTechSchool co-learning in Zurich, we often do short exercises during the last half an hour.

This directory contains solutions in Pythons to past exercises.

If you want to submit a solution:

- fork this repository and create a new branch.
- create a directory with your name in the directory that has been created for the exercise.  
  As an example, Ale's solution to the hangman exercise will be in `20-min-projects/hangman/ale/`.
- If you fell like, you can also add a `README.md` file in your directory.
- Make a pull request to let us know that it's time to add your solution to this collection.

If you don't know (yet) how to make a pull request, please add your code to <http://paste.opensuse.org/> and then post the resulting link in notes to the meetup event. We will then create a directory for you.
